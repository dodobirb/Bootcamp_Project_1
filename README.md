# Bank-to-Mortgage Trends: Pythonic Data Analysis

Project #1, UNCC/Trilogy Education Services *FinTech Bootcamp*

Consumer mortgage performance trends â€‹provide a snapshot about the overall health of the economy. The largest US banks recovered quickly after the 2008 financial crisis while a record number of households could not make mortgage payments on-time.

The goal of this project is to determine what correlation
existed between the stock market performance of 14
large US banks compared to the mortgage delinquency
rates of the largest 200+ US metro areas.

This is accomplished through examining stock market
performance trends and mortgage delinquency rates
utilizing time-series and geospatial analysis.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.8.8 with the following packages:

* [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/getting_started/install.html) - For creating dataframes and conducting data analysis from a varity of geospatial data formats. Follow link for more information about this library.

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - For interactive visualizations. Follow link for more information about this library.

* [geoviews](https://geoviews.org/) - For geocentric interactive visualizations. Follow link for more information about this library.

* [holoviews](https://holoviews.org/) - For annotated and interactive visualizations. Follow link for more information about this library.

* [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) - For cartographic overlays used in geospatial visualizations. Follow link for more information about this library.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For creating dataframes and conducting data analysis from a varity of data sources. Follow link for more information about this library.

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/pathlib.html) - For navigating file system paths. Follow link for more information about this library.

* [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) - For downloading stock data. Follow link for more information about this library.

## Installation Guide

```python
  pip install geopandas
  pip install pandas
  pin install hvplot
  pip install cartopy
  pip install geoviews
  pip install holoviews
  pip install yfinance
  ```

  The other libraries should be part of the standard Python installation.

## Usage

To review the analysis files, clone the repository and run the files in the following order after launching Jupyter Lab or VS Code from any CLI (Git BASH, Conda, Miniconda, Powershell, etc.). Upon launching the Jupyter notebook files you will step through one code block at a time. 

First run **yahoo_data_download_csv_analysis_plot_1.ipynb**

* This notebook serves as a prepper for the next one. Its sole purpose is to download the scraped Yahoo Finance bank stock info required for subsequent analysis.

Next run **stocks_to_mort_analysis_plot_2.ipynb**

* This is where the primary analysis happens and overlay plots are created.

Finally run **Mortgage delinquency rates analysis.ipynb**

There are 15 code blocks in total in the **Mortgage delinquency rates analysis.ipynb** with a brief summary of each section.

* #1: Imports all relevant libraries for data wrangling, data visualizations, and data analysis
* #2: Imports, cleans, and formats "Mortgage performance trends" data from https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/mortgage-performance-trends/download-the-data/
    Imports, cleans, and formats "CBSA codes and polygonal geometry coordinate" data from https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html
    * Displays combined dataframe on screen and exports to excel file. The dataframe is used in code blocks #3 to #6
* #3 to #6: Generates multiple cartographic maps of 200+ metro areas average mortgage delinquency rates in 2008 and 2020 to present a visual representation of the data. Code block #6 presents two maps side-by-side to provide a visualization to view 2008 vs 2020.
* #7: Re-cast the dataset as a new dataframe to build time-series, scatter, and boxplot charts used in code blocks #8 to #11
* #8: Creates an interactive time series line plot and data table for mortgage delinquency rates by metro area  
* #9: Provides the range of average rates to visualize the range across all 200+ metro areas in a scatter plot
* #10: Provides the rolling 12-month average rates to visualize the trend across all time periods in a time series line plot
* #11: Generates multiple boxplots. First, one for every metro area (200+) using all data points. Second, interactive box plot to select an individual metro area and see a boxplot for each year from 2008 to 2021.
* #12: Import, clean, and format stock data to use for the correlation analysis from the yfiance python library. Also combine into a single dataframe for code blocks #13 to #15
* #13 to #15: Calculate scatter plots and correlation coefficients between the mortgage delinquency rate data and bank stock data. 
    *#13: All data used (2008 to March 2021) showing no correlation
    *#14: Portion of data used (2008 to 2010) showing a weak positive correlation
    *#15: Portion of data used (2018 to March 2021) showing a weak negative correlation.
